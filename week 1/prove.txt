None

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
This was the first time I created my own server (outside of Apache or something similar). It was neat to see how that could be done with node.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
The prove assignment submission was a little confusing, but I think that feedback has been clearly made in Teams. ;)

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements -CHECK
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I don't think I went above and beyond (although I did try to add placeholder text to the input field. It didn't like it though.) All I added was a heading to the index page instructing the user to insert their name. This was just most html code though.
