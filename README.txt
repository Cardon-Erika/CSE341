I've been playing around with the file system, trying to find what makes the most sense. This is what I've landed on.

cse341-project-master: This folder holds the team assignments.
node_js_project: This folder holds the build that we do along with the videos for the online store.
week'x': These folders hold the assignments that Max gives us at the end of each video. They also hold the corresponding weekly prove assigment file.
