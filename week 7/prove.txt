In the feedback for last week's assignment you pointed out that when my 404 page is called it always looked like the user is signed out. I dug around and cannot figure out why this is. My auth controller is looking for isAuthenticated.

I thought this assignment was pretty straightforward and it was fun to tweak the project we had been working on for the past several weeks.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:

I think I could have added in more, but I did add in elements that made it differ from the project we coded along with Max.
