1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):
https://cse341-cardon.herokuapp.com/

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/Cardon-Erika/CSE341

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning.
Creating a new user is working.
Signing it with an existing user is working.
The error for incorrect email or password is thrown.
The error for an email already existing is thrown.
Emails are sent upon signup. (I did comment out my api_key for SendMail based on other students saying that pushing to git with the in the code deactivated their account.)

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
None - I believe everything is working.

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
The flash messages was interesting to learn about. That makes it easy to show an error without having to hardcode it in and set it to hidden until needed.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
Update the instructions for SendMail. That took a bit of exploring to figure out the steps I hadn't done that SendMail needed that weren't in the video.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements - CHECK
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I've coded along with the videos, but there hasn't really been much to expand on yet.
