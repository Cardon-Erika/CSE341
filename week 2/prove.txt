1. Copy and paste the URL for your web application (e.g., Heroku):
Not relevant yet.

2. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/Cardon-Erika/CSE341

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
All of the elements of the application are functioning.

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
None

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
I thought the templating was so interesting. One thing that bothers me about straight HTML is the ability to plug in common elements, like headers and a nav. It is not surprising, but still is awesome to see that building this way you can include common elements (because I don't always want to build in PHP.)

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
I think this week was pretty straight forward.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   4 - Meets requirements - CHECK
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
I've coded along with the videos, but there hasn't really been much to expand on yet.
With my team we did go a bit beyond what the prove assignments called for, at least with the depth of the logic.
